Transform this photo into a realistic documentary-style scene set inside a modern orbital space station during an ordinary workday. Preserve the exact facial structure, likeness, skin tone, hairstyle, body proportions, emotional expression, number of people, and original camera angle (selfie perspective remains arm-extended if applicable, group spacing remains consistent). Replace the background with a contemporary space station module featuring clean metallic panels, labeled equipment, velcro strips, mounted tablets, soft LED light strips, exposed cables, and storage compartments. Integrate a large cupola-style observation window behind or beside the subject with Earth clearly visible in correct scale and curvature, showing cloud systems and a bright limb against deep black space, with subtle glass reflections and no overexposed highlights. Adapt posture naturally to zero gravity with slight relaxed floating alignment, small objects gently drifting nearby, and minimal lift in hair or clothing while maintaining natural proportions and avoiding distortion, extra limbs, or visual artifacts. Dress the subject in modern astronaut station attire such as a fitted utility shirt or contemporary aerospace jumpsuit in white, gray, navy, or muted blue with optional subtle mission patch. Use cool white interior lighting combined with soft blue Earth light spill, physically accurate shadows, photorealistic metal, fabric, and glass textures, natural skin rendering without plastic smoothing, and slight depth of field keeping the subject sharp and Earth slightly softer. The result should feel like high-resolution cinematic space agency photography captured on a full-frame camera with a 35–50mm lens, balanced exposure, calm professional mood, and grounded near-future realism rather than science fiction fantasy.
