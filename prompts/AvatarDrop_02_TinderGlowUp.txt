===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the person’s face identity or facial structure. No “model swap,” no face reshaping, no exaggerated jawline, no eye size changes, no lip plumping, no heavy glam makeup, no plastic skin. No sexualized styling, no revealing outfits, no lingerie, no fetish aesthetics. No text, no watermarks, no logos. If other people are present, blur them strongly and ensure no hands/arms from others enter the frame near the subject; no interaction. No AI artifacts, no double pupils, no extra fingers.
Transformation directives: Create a warm, flattering golden-hour portrait that still looks realistic and natural. Only transform the center-face subject (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). Add gentle depth-of-field with pleasing bokeh and a lifestyle background such as a street café or park (realistic, not cheesy). Enrich colors slightly and add soft warm sunlight direction; keep skin texture natural with light blemish reduction only. Keep a “date-ready” vibe while remaining believable and unedited-looking.
Identity invariants: Preserve exact facial likeness, proportions, expression, gaze direction, and skin tone accuracy of the selected subject; keep hairstyle and defining features consistent. Keep the number of people the same; only the selected subject is transformed.
Technical/realism: Photorealistic portrait, natural lens blur, balanced warm color grading, clean detail, high-resolution.
