Transform the provided photo into a cinematic urban portrait “New York Street Survivor,” placing the subject authentically within a gritty New York City street environment while preserving the exact facial identity, bone structure, skin tone, proportions, and natural expression with 1:1 likeness accuracy. Maintain full recognizability and avoid beautification or stylization of facial features; introduce only subtle environmental realism such as faint under-eye fatigue, slight wind-reddened skin, natural skin texture, and light stubble if appropriate. Keep the original hairstyle, color, and length unchanged, styled only with mild wind disruption and natural outdoor irregularity. Replace the wardrobe with layered, realistically worn urban clothing such as a faded neutral hoodie or flannel, an oversized weathered parka or heavy street coat, slightly worn jeans or cargo pants, and practical aged sneakers or boots, complemented by understated accessories like a knitted beanie, fingerless gloves, and a worn backpack or duffel; fabrics must show believable wear without appearing theatrical or costume-like. Position the subject naturally on a city sidewalk, subway entrance steps, or leaning against a wall or steam vent with a relaxed yet guarded posture, hands in pockets or holding a simple paper coffee cup. Set the scene on a realistic New York street with brick buildings, graffiti-marked walls, subway signage, and steam rising from street vents, with distant blurred yellow taxis and soft traffic bokeh adding depth; keep the subject sharply focused while the background falls into cinematic shallow depth of field. Use natural daylight or cool evening city lighting with soft directional shadows, subtle film grain, and muted cinematic color grading that blends cool blue tones with gentle warm streetlight highlights. Avoid exaggerated drama, glamorized homelessness tropes, caricatured distress, glossy fashion-editorial styling, distorted anatomy, or artificial digital effects, ensuring the final image feels grounded, observational, and filmic while the subject remains fully and unmistakably themselves.
