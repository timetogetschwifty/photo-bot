===PROMPT===
Transform this photo into a cinematic marriage proposal scene set in front of the Eiffel Tower at sunset during the blue-to-gold twilight transition. Make the female subject from the original image the emotional focal point in the foreground, fully recognizable with her exact facial identity, proportions, skin tone, ethnicity, and natural skin texture preserved. Capture the precise micro-moment of realization: eyes widening slightly, one hand rising toward her mouth, a smile just beginning, emotional but authentic and not exaggerated. Add warm golden-hour rim lighting outlining her hair and shoulders, soft wraparound key light on her face, and gentle ambient twilight fill, maintaining natural body proportions and avoiding any distortion, extra limbs, or artificial smoothing.

Place a man kneeling slightly lower in the frame in the mid-to-foreground, holding an open ring box that is clearly visible yet not overpowering; keep him intentionally out of focus with his face turned away or cropped out, minimizing identity detail. Replace the original background completely with a realistic Paris skyline at sunset, positioning the Eiffel Tower slightly off-center at accurate scale and distance, its lights just beginning to shimmer with early city bokeh. Introduce subtle floating rose petals suspended mid-air and cinematic depth separation using a shallow 85mm–135mm portrait lens look, with soft foreground blur and creamy background bokeh.

Refine her outfit into elegant evening styling with a flowy dress in a neutral romantic palette, adding slight fabric movement from a gentle breeze and soft wind interaction in her hair. Apply warm amber highlights, soft blush skin tones, muted shadows with slight teal undertones, a cinematic contrast curve, subtle highlight bloom, faint lens flare from the sunset edge, and very light film grain. Preserve realism and aspirational authenticity, avoiding cartoonish rendering, over-processed fantasy effects, influencer-style gloss, or staged artificiality, so the final image feels like a still frame from a romantic feature film captured in cinematic 4K clarity.
