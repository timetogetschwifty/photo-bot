===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by placing the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable) alone outside a luxury ski chalet at twilight with gentle snowfall. Composition: medium shot (waist-up), subject slightly off-center with warm chalet lights behind creating cozy bokeh; the subject faces camera loosely but eyes can be soft and calm, expression peaceful—not hyped. Outfit: premium winter layers in muted tones (cream puffer or wool coat, knit beanie optional, scarf), with a cozy prop like a simple hot drink mug or a folded blanket draped over one arm (no logos). Snow is subtle: small flakes in foreground and background, not covering the face; breathy cold atmosphere with warm/cool contrast. Lighting: warm backlight from chalet windows + cool ambient snow light, soft glow on cheeks, cinematic winter grade.
Constraints: solo subject only; keep snow light and not on eyes/mouth; no readable text/logos; avoid extra people; correct hands/fingers; no clutter around the chalet entrance.
