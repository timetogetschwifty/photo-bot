===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) with unchanged facial likeness, proportions, expression, skin tone, and gaze; keep pose, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition identical; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is editable. Transformation directives: Only change the hair of the center_face subject into “Cloud Cut Layers”: mid-length, floaty, weightless layers with a soft puffed silhouette, airy movement around cheeks and jaw, and a plush halo-like fullness without heaviness; add subtle crown lift and feathered layering that looks naturally grown-in, with realistic strand separation and volume that follows head shape; blur all other people so they read as background while the main subject stays sharp. Negatives: Do not alter the face at all; no over-inflated hair volume, no rigid “wig” edges, no cut lines that look pasted on, no crunchy texture, no extreme frizz unless already present; no visible remnants of the original haircut; no extra people added or removed; no other people’s hands/arms intruding into the main subject area; no text, logos, watermarks, or skin-smoothing beauty filter artifacts. Technical/realism: Keep the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color, and depth of field consistent for seamless realism.
