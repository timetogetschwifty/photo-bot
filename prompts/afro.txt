Create a vintage 1970s "Love is..." greeting card illustration based on the couple photo. This MUST match the exact artistic style of Kim Casali's original 1970s "Love is..." postcards - NOT modern couple illustrations.

MANDATORY REFERENCE STYLE:
Study and replicate the EXACT visual language of original 1970s Kim Casali "Love is..." greeting cards:
- Cherubic cartoon figures with innocent presentation
- Extremely simple dots-for-eyes, curved-line-for-smile
- Classic back-view pose showing signature silhouette
- Large round heads on small chubby bodies
- Thin delicate hand-drawn black line art
- Minimal detail - almost stick-figure simplicity
- Vintage cream/pastel postcard background

THIS IS CRITICAL: If you don't know this specific retro style, the result will fail. Study authentic Kim Casali "Love is..." cards from the 1970s.

CHARACTER SPECIFICATIONS:

Proportions (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- HUGE round heads (almost as wide as body height)
- Very small, chubby, childlike bodies
- Short little legs
- Round bellies
- Plump arms
- Think: cherub baby proportions, NOT adult or teen bodies
- Almost bobblehead-like head size

Pose & View:
- Figures shown FROM BEHIND (classic "Love is..." signature view)
- Classic minimalist back-view silhouette
- Simple shorts or minimal clothing (back view only)
- Barefoot with simple rounded feet
- Standing close together or gentle embrace
- Always tasteful back/side views only

Faces (EXTREMELY MINIMAL):
- Two small black dots for eyes
- One simple curved line for smile
- NO other facial features at all
- NO nose, eyebrows, eyelashes, or detail
- Round head shape
- Faces barely visible if shown from behind

Hair (Primary Personalization):
From the couple photo:
- Male: Short brown/dark wavy hair - draw with simple curved lines suggesting waves and volume
- Female: Long flowing dark hair past shoulders - draw with flowing curved lines
- Use VERY simple line work - just suggestion of hair texture
- Hair color in soft muted tones (brown for him, dark brown/black for her in pastel)

Skin Tone:
- Match couple's skin tones in soft pastel illustration
- Light peachy-cream tones
- Flat color, no shading

Body Personalization (Minimal):
- Keep cherubic childlike proportions for both
- Slightly differentiate male (slightly broader shoulders) and female (slightly curved)
- But maintain cute, innocent, chubby baby-like quality for both

POSE FROM PHOTO ANALYSIS:
The couple is embracing closely - translate this to:
- Two figures standing close, viewed from behind
- Male figure slightly taller, female leaning into him
- Her arm around his waist or his arm around her shoulder
- Simple, tender, innocent embrace

LINE ART STYLE:
- Thin, delicate BLACK lines ONLY
- Hand-drawn quality with slight imperfection (not perfect vectors)

TEXT PLACEMENT:

"Love is..." text:
- Positioned at bottom center
- Hand-written style font (rounded, casual, friendly)
- Black or dark brown color
- Format: "Love is..."
- Then below: "a hug that feels like home." (or similar sweet phrase based on photo context)

Optional: One small simple heart symbol

COMPOSITION:

CRITICAL STYLE NOTES:

What This IS:
- 1970s Kim Casali "Love is..." aesthetic
- Cherubic cartoon figures (innocent)
- Viewed from behind in signature pose
- Dots and smile only for face
- HUGE heads, tiny chubby bodies
- Thin black hand-drawn lines
- Vintage cream background
- Radically simple and minimal
- Pure innocent wholesomeness

What This is NOT:
- Modern minimalist couple illustration
- Adult figures with normal proportions
- Detailed faces or features
- Contemporary flat design aesthetic
- Clean vector graphics
- Bright modern colors
- Any complexity or detail

AUTHENTICITY REQUIREMENTS:
- Must look like it was drawn in 1970
- Must look like authentic Kim Casali artwork
- Must be immediately recognizable as "Love is..." style
- Must have that specific nostalgic greeting card quality
- Hand-drawn warmth, NOT digital precision

EMOTIONAL TONE:
- Pure innocent sweetness

FINAL CHECK:
Does this look EXACTLY like a vintage 1970s "Love is..." greeting card you'd find in an antique shop? If not, it needs to be MORE simple, MORE childlike, MORE minimal, MORE vintage.

The couple should be recognizable by their hair while maintaining the iconic cherubic back-view "Love is..." aesthetic that defined the original cards.
