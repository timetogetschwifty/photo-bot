Core transformation instruction:
Transform the person in the uploaded photo by giving them a very dense, large, natural afro hairstyle while keeping the face fully recognizable and preserving all other elements of the photo unchanged.

Face:
Maintain the exact facial identity with 1:1 accuracy — same face shape, eye spacing, nose, lips, skin tone, skin texture, and expression. No beautification, no smoothing, no reshaping. Eyes must remain naturally aligned and looking in the same direction as in the original photo.

Hair:
Replace the existing hairstyle with an extra-dense, full, voluminous natural afro haircut featuring tightly packed curls and high natural volume. The afro should have a realistic rounded silhouette with organically irregular curl clustering, subtle variation in curl size, and natural micro-stray hairs along the perimeter to avoid any artificial edge. Hairline must remain anatomically correct and consistent with the original forehead proportions. Hair color must exactly match the person’s original hair color and, if the person has a beard or facial hair, the afro color must also match the beard color for full consistency. Ensure lighting reflections, highlights, and shadows on the afro match the original scene lighting direction.

Outfit:
Keep the original clothing, accessories, and textures unchanged.

Background:
Preserve the exact original background, depth of field, perspective, and environmental lighting with no modifications.

Lighting & realism:
Ensure seamless integration with scene lighting, including realistic highlight distribution, soft shadow falloff on the face and shoulders, and subtle contact shadows where the hair overlaps the forehead, ears, and neck. Avoid halo artifacts, edge cutouts, or unnatural uniform texture.

Preservation rule:
Keep the person’s face recognizable and maintain their facial features and expression exactly as in the source image.
