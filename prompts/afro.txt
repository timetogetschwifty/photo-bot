===PROMPT===
Transform this photo by replacing the existing hairstyle of every visible person with a large, stylish afro while keeping everything else exactly unchanged. Preserve the exact face likeness, facial proportions, expression, head position, body posture, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, depth of field, image composition, skin tone accuracy, and the number of people. The afro must be full, rounded, voluminous, and naturally textured with visible curl structure and organic density, sized proportionally to each individual’s head and distance from the camera so it feels balanced and flattering rather than exaggerated. Integrate the hairline seamlessly along the forehead and temples, blending naturally with the scalp and matching the person’s original hair color unless realism requires a subtle natural tone for bald individuals. Ensure the texture appears soft and believable, with slight natural asymmetry and depth, avoiding helmet-like shapes, over-symmetry, caricature styling, retro parody vibes, or cartoonish texture. Maintain the original image’s lighting characteristics, including shadow direction and softness, allowing realistic shadow integration around the forehead, ears, and neck. For group photos, apply an individually proportioned afro to each person without overlapping or merging hair shapes. Replace long or short hair completely without leaving visible remnants. Keep resolution, sharpness, and noise level consistent with the original image, avoiding over-sharpening, distortion of facial features, extra elements, artifacts, clipping, or flat edges so the result feels like a genuine, confident, modern haircut choice captured in a professional lifestyle portrait.
