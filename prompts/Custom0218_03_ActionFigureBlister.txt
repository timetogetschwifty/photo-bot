===PROMPT===
Negatives: Remove all other people completely, including hands, arms, or body parts from others. Only transform the largest_face subject; deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected. Do not keep the person as a flat photo pasted into a box; they must become a realistic 3D collectible figure. No brand logos that mimic real toy brands, no copyrighted packaging designs, no unreadable barcode text, no deformed plastic reflections.
Transformation directives: Put the person inside a realistic toy blister package like an action figure. The package should include a big product name using the exact text “STARTER PACK” and a subtitle area with the exact text “INCLUDES ACCESSORIES.” Render the main subject as a high-quality 3D collectible version of them inside the plastic, with realistic plastic reflections, studio lighting, and a clean cardboard backing design. Add 3–5 accessories in separate molded compartments: a mug, a laptop, headphones, a snack, and a small “deadline list” card (the card text should be readable and say “DEADLINES”). Include a generic barcode block and small warning icons that are clearly fictional.
Identity invariants: Preserve eye spacing, nose bridge shape, and signature smile so the figure is recognizable. Modify convert face into a polished 3D toy material, smooth micro-texture into vinyl/plastic sheen, slightly exaggerate contours for figurine readability, add studio-lit reflections, unify skin into collectible paint finish. Result recognizable because the eye spacing + nose bridge + smile pattern anchor identity even in toy form.
Technical/realism: Photoreal product-shot quality with sharp focus, accurate specular highlights on plastic blister, clean packaging print, and coherent shadows.
