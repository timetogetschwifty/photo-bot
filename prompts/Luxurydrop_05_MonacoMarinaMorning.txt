===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by placing the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable) alone on a marina promenade at sunrise. Shot design: cinematic medium shot (waist-up) walking toward camera at a slight angle; the subject is sharp and primary while the background yachts are softly blurred and pushed into gentle bokeh. The subject holds a simple takeaway coffee cup in one hand (no branding, no readable text) and wears a minimalist morning outfit in neutral tones (cream trench, simple tee, tailored pants). Sky is pastel sunrise (peach, lavender) with clean early-morning light; the marina feels organized and quiet, with subtle reflections on water. Expression: centered, calm, unbothered—like this is a routine. Lighting: soft sunrise key + cool ambient fill, delicate rim on hair and shoulders, airy premium grade.
Constraints: solo subject only; keep yachts/background soft-focus; no readable text/logos/watermarks; avoid clutter on promenade; natural hands; no extra people near the subject.
