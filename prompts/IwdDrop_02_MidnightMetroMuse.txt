===PROMPT===
Negatives: Remove the original background entirely; no identifiable city names, no real station names, no readable ads, no brand logos, no transit authority logos, no watermarks. Keep signage generic and non-identifying. No extra people: keep other people unchanged in background only if they exist, but ensure they do not interact with the subject; no hands or arms from other people touching the subject. No identity change, no face distortion, no extra limbs, no duplicated face.
Transformation directives: Place the subject in a stylish late-night metro platform scene with neon reflections on glossy surfaces, soft foggy ambience, and distant bokeh headlights. Add a subtle bouquet silhouette in the background (not held by another person), fashion-editorial lighting, and cinematic grain. Transform outfit into a sleek coat and scarf with premium fabric texture; keep styling elegant and modern. Use generic platform signage (abstract arrows, simple numbers) with no real-world identifiers.
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact face likeness, facial proportions, gaze, expression, skin tone accuracy, age, and identity of the subject. Only transform the center_face subject; if there is a tie, choose by largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected. Keep any other people unchanged in the background_only role.
Technical/realism: Photorealistic, cinematic night lighting with neon rim highlights, realistic reflections, mild film grain, shallow depth of field, high-resolution fashion editorial finish.
