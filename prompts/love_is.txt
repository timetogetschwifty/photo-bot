Paper texture & print aging (gum insert look):
- Render the entire greeting card as if printed on thin vintage chewing-gum insert paper: slightly crumpled surface with subtle micro-creases, soft fold marks, very light corner wear, and faint uneven paper waviness. 
- Add gentle paper fiber texture visible under soft lighting, with mild desaturation and slightly matte ink absorption so black outlines look printed rather than digitally sharp. 
- Include minimal printing imperfections such as tiny ink density variations and barely noticeable off-white paper aging (warm cream tint), while keeping all illustration details fully legible and clean. Avoid heavy wrinkles — the card should look lightly handled, softly crumpled, and nostalgic, not damaged.
