===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by placing the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable) alone on a clean, modern yacht deck in bright daytime. Shot design: cinematic medium-wide portrait (mid-thigh to head), camera slightly low and angled toward the subject near a white yacht railing; ocean and horizon open behind in soft focus. The subject’s posture is relaxed—one hand resting lightly on the railing—wind gently moving hair; expression is calm with a tiny soft smile that reads “content.” Color palette: white/cream yacht surfaces, pale blue sea, sunlit highlights; minimal props only (one pair of sunglasses in hand OR a simple drink on a small side ledge). Add subtle jewelry (thin chain, small earrings) with tasteful sparkle. Lighting: clean sun with soft diffusion, natural skin glow, crisp but not harsh shadows, airy premium look.
Constraints: solo subject only; keep deck uncluttered; no readable text/logos on boat; avoid extra limbs/warped hands; no crowd/party elements; keep the sea and deck simple and elegant.
