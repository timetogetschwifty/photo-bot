Transform this photo by replacing the visible phone or camera device in the person’s hand with a realistic, sweet-looking young kitten (approximately 2–4 months old) positioned in exactly the same spatial location and orientation as the original device. Maintain the exact facial features, face shape, skin tone, hair, body proportions, posture, clothing, framing, and overall composition of every person in the image. The hand grip must look natural and gentle, with fingers wrapped around the kitten as if carefully holding a small pet, including subtle paw placement over the fingers for believable interaction. The kitten’s eyes must look in the exact same direction as the holder’s gaze, with aligned pupils and matching catchlights, so if the person looks straight ahead the kitten looks straight, and if the person looks slightly to one side the kitten mirrors that direction precisely. Render in photorealistic lifestyle photography style with soft diffused natural light, warm and cozy tones, subtle cinematic realism similar to modern smartphone portrait photography, natural color grading, and a 4K-resolution feel. Ensure high-detail fur texture, realistic shadow casting from the kitten onto the hand, consistent light direction, accurate depth of field, sharp focus on the subject, and subtle bokeh only if present in the original. Completely remove all traces of the phone including edges, lenses, reflections, or brand artifacts. Preserve mirror geometry accurately in mirror selfies so the kitten appears correctly in the reflection instead of the device. Enhance low-quality inputs subtly while keeping natural skin texture and avoiding over-sharpening or plastic smoothing. Maintain a calm, gentle expression on the kitten, avoid distortion of facial features, no extra limbs, no artifacts, and no exaggerated or cartoon styling so the final result feels like a believable, wholesome moment where the person casually holds a tiny kitten instead of a phone.
