===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity and facial likeness of the center_face subject (same face shape, facial proportions, eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, skin tone, expression, age, and gender), plus the original head position, body pose, clothing, accessories, background, composition, and the exact number of people. Keep all non-hair elements unchanged.
Transformation directives: Only transform the center_face subject’s haircut into a long-length style that keeps overall length while forming a clean U-shaped perimeter at the back (longer center, slightly shorter sides), with long blended “supermodel” layers. Add face-framing layers that begin around the cheekbone area and cascade smoothly down toward the collarbone, creating a big, bouncy, camera-ready shape without looking shorter overall. The layers should be airy and blended (no choppy steps), with subtle outward flips and movement at the ends, like a fresh salon blowout; keep hair color consistent with the original unless the original color is unclear, then choose a natural medium brown. If there are other people in the photo, keep the center_face subject perfectly sharp while blurring all other people so they remain background context only.
Negatives: Do not change the face, eyebrows, eye shape, makeup, skin texture, or expression; no face reshaping or beautification filter. Do not shorten the hair into a bob or lob; keep the perceived length, only reshape with U-perimeter and long layers. No uneven or jagged ends, no harsh shelf layers, no “mullet” silhouette, and no duplicated hair or ghosting. No wig-like helmet volume; hair must connect naturally at the scalp and follow believable strand direction. No extra people added, no identity swaps or merged faces; no hands/arms from other people intruding into the main subject area, and no sharp focus on background people (they must be blurred). Avoid artifacts around the jawline, neck, shoulders, and collar area where long hair overlaps clothing.
Technical/realism: Match the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color balance, depth of field, and camera realism so the new layered cut blends naturally.
