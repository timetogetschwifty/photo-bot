===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) with unchanged facial likeness, face shape, skin tone, expression, and head position; keep body posture, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition the same; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only transform the hair of the center_face subject into a “bixie with micro fringe”: pixie-meets-bob shape with choppy, editorial texture, shorter lengths around the crown and sides, slightly longer pieces toward the nape, and a sharp micro fringe that sits clearly above the eyebrows; ensure believable haircut geometry, natural hairline, and piecey separation that looks professionally cut rather than pasted; blur all other people into the background while keeping the main subject crisp and in focus. Negatives: Do not modify the face or eyebrows; no fringe covering the eyes, no uneven melted-looking bangs, no plastic wig shine, no jagged artifacts around the forehead; no original long hair remaining visible; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms near or overlapping the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or beautifying skin filters. Technical/realism: Match the original lighting, shadows, color balance, and depth of field so the short cut looks naturally present in the same photo.
