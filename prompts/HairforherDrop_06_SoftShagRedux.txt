===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) including facial likeness, facial proportions, skin tone, expression, and gaze; keep pose, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition unchanged; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only change the hair of the center_face subject into a modern “soft shag”: feathered layers with textured ends, lived-in piecey separation (not messy), and a soft fringe that suits the forehead while keeping the look light and wearable; emphasize movement and volume around the crown and temples with realistic layering that blends into the length; blur all other people into the background while the main subject remains sharp. Negatives: Do not change the face; no overly messy “bedhead” tangles, no extreme mullet unless already present, no crunchy texture, no harsh razor artifacts; no remnants of the original haircut visible; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms intruding near the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or beauty-filter skin smoothing. Technical/realism: Match the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color, and depth of field for seamless realism.
