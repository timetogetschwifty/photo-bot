===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by rebuilding a minimal penthouse interior with floor-to-ceiling windows behind the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable), alone. Composition: cinematic portrait, medium shot (chest-up) with the subject centered and framed by the window mullions; skyline at dusk below with city lights beginning to sparkle, slightly out of focus. The subject stands or sits near the glass, body angled a little away, head turned subtly toward the city—not looking at camera—with a neutral, settled expression (“everything handled”). Interior is intentionally sparse: one modern chair/sofa edge, a clean side table, muted palette (stone, beige, charcoal), no clutter. Lighting: soft rim light from the window edge outlining hair and shoulders, gentle interior fill shaping the face; filmic contrast, smooth gradients, polished cinematic mood.
Constraints: solo subject only; no readable text/logos; keep decor minimal; avoid mirror/reflection artifacts that duplicate the face; natural hands; no extra people or extra limbs.
