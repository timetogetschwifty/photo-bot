===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) with unchanged facial likeness, facial proportions, skin tone, expression, and head position; keep body posture, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition unchanged; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only transform the hair of the center_face subject into a “blunt glassy lob”: collarbone-length, razor-clean blunt edge with a crisp straight line, minimal layering, and a super glossy glass-like finish that still looks like real hair; keep thickness consistent at the ends, maintain a natural hairline, and add subtle root polish without changing the face; blur all other people into the background while the main subject stays sharp. Negatives: Do not change the face; no uneven hemline, no jagged cut artifacts, no plastic mirror shine, no greasy look, no hair clipping into clothing; no remnants of the original hairstyle visible; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms overlapping the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or beauty-filter skin smoothing. Technical/realism: Match the original lighting, shadows, color balance, and depth of field for seamless integration.
