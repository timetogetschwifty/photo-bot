===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact face likeness of the main subject (largest_face), including facial features, bone structure, skin tone, age, expression, gaze direction, hairstyle, and identity; preserve body proportions and pose; keep the image framing and camera angle consistent. Only transform the largest_face subject; blur any other people into an unrecognizable background presence while keeping the main subject crisp.
Transformation directives: Restyle the image into a soft, intimate “sunset through curtains” portrait: add warm golden-hour window-light stripes cast across the scene and partially across the subject in a flattering way (not obscuring key facial features), with gentle floating dust motes visible in the light beams. Create a cozy indoor feel by adding subtle background blur (room blur/bokeh) while keeping the main subject sharp and natural. Add a tiny, classy date stamp that reads “7 March” in the corner (small, elegant, minimal, no location cues), matching the aesthetic like a premium candid photoshoot.
Negatives: Do not change the subject’s identity or facial features; no face reshaping, no beautification filters that alter likeness, no heavy makeup additions, no eye color change. No readable location indicators (no street names, landmarks, signage, maps, window views with identifiable skylines), no names, no personal data. No extra people becoming sharp; blur all non-main subjects strongly. No extra limbs, missing fingers, warped hands, double faces, skin smearing, banding, overexposed stripes, or artificial-looking dust blobs; avoid harsh shadow lines cutting across eyes/mouth.
Technical/realism: Use warm golden-hour color grading (amber/gold highlights, soft contrast), smooth film-like texture, realistic light falloff, and clean high-resolution output with natural skin detail.
