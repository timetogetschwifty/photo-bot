===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not add or remove people. Do not merge, swap, or blend faces or identities between different people. No duplicated faces, no “same face pasted” effect, no mismatched left-to-right order, and no shifting someone to a different position. No modern elements (modern logos, contemporary typography, smartphones, modern street signs, modern military insignia). No Latin headline text and no misspelled or mirrored Cyrillic; avoid gibberish text. No plastic/3D CGI look, no photorealistic skin pores, no anime style. No extra limbs, no missing fingers, no deformed hands, no warped eyes/teeth, no stretched heads, no heavy blur on faces.

Transformation directives: Transform the input photo into a vintage 1950s–60s Soviet celebratory postcard for “23 February” with a painterly propaganda-poster look: bold warm reds and creams, strong graphic shapes, visible brushstroke texture, slightly grainy printed-paper feel, and festive red flags/banners in the scene. Add a big hand-painted Cyrillic headline across the top reading exactly: “23 ФЕВРАЛЯ” (clear, centered, poster-style brush lettering), and add a smaller secondary line near the bottom reading: “С ДНЁМ ЗАЩИТНИКА ОТЕЧЕСТВА!” (legible, not mirrored, consistent painted lettering). Style the clothing as era-appropriate: simplified military-inspired or civilian праздничный look with medals/ribbons only if they appear plausible and not modern; keep outfits cohesive with the poster era. Set a heroic, optimistic mood: upright posture, confident expressions, patriotic vibe; if the original pose is casual, subtly adapt it into a dignified poster pose while keeping the same overall body positions.

Identity invariants: HYBRID face handling. Preserve eye shape and eye color, nose and lips proportions, face silhouette, and each person’s signature expression for recognizability. Modify the rendering into a painterly poster interpretation with slight idealized symmetry, smoother skin rendered with brush texture, era-appropriate hair/grooming, and lighting shaped like a painted poster. Group safety: preserve each person’s identity separately with unique facial anchors; no merging/swapping. Subject handling (single + group): If exactly one clear face is detected, transform only the largest_face subject; keep any other people (if present) as background-only and not promoted into main characters. If multiple clear faces are detected, transform all_detected_faces consistently up to max_subjects = 6, preserving left-to-right order and relative positions; if more than 6 faces exist, transform the top 6 by largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face priority and keep remaining faces as soft, non-distracting background context without changing their identity.

Technical/realism: Maintain coherent poster-style lighting and shadows consistent across all subjects, with high legibility of faces and Cyrillic text, crisp edges where appropriate, and subtle paper/print texture without destroying facial likeness.
