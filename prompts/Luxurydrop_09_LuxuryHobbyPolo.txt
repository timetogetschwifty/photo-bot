===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by placing the same person alone at a sunlit polo field during a lesson, keeping them clearly recognizable while applying a subtle elite-sport grooming/styling refinement (HYBRID): preserve the eyes, face shape, and their signature smile/neutral mouth, but slightly clean up hair, add polished natural makeup/skin finish, and tidy styling to match a high-end sport aesthetic. Composition: dynamic but controlled 3/4 medium shot (thigh-up) with the subject as the hero in the foreground holding a polo mallet at rest; a horse appears secondary and slightly behind/side, softly blurred, not dominating the frame. Wardrobe: clean sporty luxury (white/cream polo kit, fitted riding pants, simple belt), helmet on or tucked under arm (no logos), dust motes and warm sunlight for atmosphere. Lighting: golden late-afternoon sun with soft highlights, gentle rim light, shallow depth of field; calm confidence expression—composed, not straining.
Constraints: solo human subject only; horse must be secondary; no readable text/logos; avoid extra people; ensure correct hands/grip and believable mallet; no face merging/duplication; keep the scene elegant and uncluttered.
