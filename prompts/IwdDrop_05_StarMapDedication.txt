===PROMPT===
Negatives: Remove original background completely; no real addresses, no real GPS coordinates, no city names, no identifiable landmarks, no watermarks. Keep any coordinates fictional or omit them entirely. No identity change, no facial distortion, no extra limbs, no duplicate faces. No extra people: keep other people unchanged in background_only if present, but ensure no interaction with subject; no hands/arms from others touching the subject.
Transformation directives: Build a clean “night sky chart” aesthetic behind the subject’s portrait with subtle stardust, thin constellation lines, and a neat coordinate-grid graphic style. Compose it like a keepsake poster: the subject centered, with minimal caption text such as “For her • 07.03” in tiny elegant type. Optionally include purely fictional coordinates in a small unobtrusive line, or omit coordinates completely if uncertain; never imply a real location.
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact face likeness, facial proportions, gaze, expression, skin tone accuracy, age, and identity of the subject. Only transform the center_face subject; if there is a tie, choose by largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected.
Technical/realism: Premium poster design realism, crisp vector-like star lines, soft luminous highlights, balanced contrast, high resolution, clean typography.
