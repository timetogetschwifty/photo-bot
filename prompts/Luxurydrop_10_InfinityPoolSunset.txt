===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by placing the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable) alone at an infinity pool at sunset overlooking the ocean horizon. Composition: cinematic close-medium portrait (shoulders to top of head, with a bit of upper chest), camera at pool edge height; the waterline stays below the chin to avoid warping, with gentle ripples leading the eye toward the infinity edge and the ocean beyond. The subject’s expression is serene and neutral, eyes soft, as if fully relaxed; wet hair and subtle skin glow catch warm sunset highlights. Background: sunset gradient (amber to pink to deep blue), calm ocean, minimal resort elements (no crowd, no signage). Lighting: warm sunset key + cool sky fill, soft specular highlights on water and cheekbones, dreamy but sharp face, shallow depth of field.
Constraints: solo subject only; keep waterline below chin; no readable text/logos/watermarks; avoid extra limbs/warped shoulders; no busy background; natural reflections without duplicate faces.
