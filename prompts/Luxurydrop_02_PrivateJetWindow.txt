===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by recreating a minimal private jet cabin scene with the same person (face preserved, instantly recognizable) seated alone by a large oval window. Composition: 3/4 profile medium shot (chest-up), camera at aisle height angled toward the window so the subject is foreground-right and the glowing window is left; the subject looks slightly down or out at the horizon with a calm, serene, neutral expression—quiet success, not excitement. Outside: clouds far below and a sunrise/sunset gradient (golden-to-rose) washing soft light into the cabin. Cabin styling is elegant and simple: cream leather seat, clean wall panels, subtle stitching, no visible labels or readable text. Lighting: warm golden key from the window + soft fill from cabin, gentle rim on hairline, smooth tones, cinematic softness, shallow depth of field. Wardrobe should feel understated-luxury (neutral knit, crisp jacket, simple watch) without logos.
Constraints: solo subject only; no readable text on panels; no brand marks; no extra faces in reflections; avoid warped hands/arms; keep background uncluttered and premium.
