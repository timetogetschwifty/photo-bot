===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the main subject’s face, identity, age, skin tone, facial proportions, or expression. No extra people added. No extra limbs, duplicated fingers, warped hands, or facial distortion. No unreadable, misspelled, or mirrored text on the sash; the sash must clearly read “8 March”. No plastic-looking flowers; avoid CGI shine. No background clutter from the original photo leaking through where the new scene should be.

Transformation directives: Create a bright spring street scene in the morning with soft golden light, gentle sun rays, and floating flower petals drifting across the frame. Place a handmade floral crown on the main subject’s head made of fresh tulips and mimosa, detailed petals and stems, naturally woven, sized realistically, and aligned to the hairline. Add a ribbon sash across the torso that reads “8 March” in elegant, legible lettering, integrated with natural folds and shadows. Blur all other people in the background while keeping the main subject sharp; only transform the largest_face subject (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected).

Identity invariants: Preserve the largest_face subject’s exact facial likeness, face shape, features, gaze direction, expression, head position, hairstyle (except the crown resting on top), body proportions, pose, and their personal identity. Keep the number of people the same, with the main subject as the focus and all non-selected faces de-emphasized. Preserve realism of skin texture and natural facial lighting consistent with the new scene; do not beautify into a different person.

Technical/realism: Render photorealistically with natural depth of field, clean edges around the crown and sash, accurate shadows, and high-detail petals with believable translucency in morning light.
