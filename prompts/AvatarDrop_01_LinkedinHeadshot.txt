===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the person’s face identity, facial structure, age, gender, skin tone, or expression. No beauty-filter “plastic” skin, no waxy smoothing, no face reshaping, no eye enlargement, no teeth replacement, no heavy makeup, no freckles removed. No extra people added. If other people are present in the input photo, blur them strongly into the background and do not let their hands/arms appear near the main subject; no arms extending into frame interacting with the subject. No logos, no text, no watermarks, no AI artifacts, no double pupils, no extra fingers.
Transformation directives: Create a crisp corporate studio headshot from the input photo. Only transform the largest-face subject (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). Replace the background with a neutral studio backdrop (light gray or soft off-white) with subtle gradient and clean separation. Add soft key light with gentle fill for professional look; keep skin texture natural with subtle retouch (reduce blemishes slightly, keep pores and realism). Add a clean modern blazer and collared shirt look (neutral colors like navy/charcoal/white), realistic fabric detail, and natural neckline fit.
Identity invariants: Preserve exact face likeness and recognizability of the selected subject: identical facial features, proportions, bone structure, eyes, nose, mouth, hairline, and expression. Preserve head position and overall pose as much as possible. Keep the number of people the same; only the selected subject is transformed.
Technical/realism: Photorealistic, sharp focus on face, clean edges, natural color, high-resolution head-and-shoulders framing.
