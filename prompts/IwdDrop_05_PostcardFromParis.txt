===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the center_face subject’s exact facial likeness, face shape, skin tone, expression, and identity; keep the subject’s pose and proportions unchanged and keep the number of people the same. Transformation directives: Restyle the image as a glossy travel postcard with a pastel sky and a classic Parisian street-corner atmosphere, adding subtle postcard grain and slight halation while keeping the subject clear. Add a stamp-style corner mark that reads “I love you” (legible, clean, not mirrored) and a handwritten line at the bottom that says “Wish you were here”, both integrated like printed-on-card elements. Keep other people unchanged in the background only; only transform the center_face subject’s styling context and postcard framing (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). Negatives: No face changes, no beauty-swap, no extra people, no unreadable or misspelled text, no real logos or travel brand marks, no heavy blur over the subject, no distorted borders. Technical/realism: Soft pastel palette, gentle film-like contrast, subtle paper texture, and realistic postcard print finish.
