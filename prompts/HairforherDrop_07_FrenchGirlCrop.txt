===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) with unchanged facial likeness, face shape, skin tone, expression, and head position; keep body posture, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition unchanged; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only transform the hair of the center_face subject into a “French girl crop”: a short, soft crop with a slightly undone shape, light natural texture, and wispy bangs that skim the eyebrows; keep the cut chic and effortless, with realistic hairline detail and subtle irregularity that still looks intentionally styled; blur all other people into the background while keeping the main subject sharply focused. Negatives: Do not change the face or eyebrow shape; no ultra-perfect bowl cut, no stiff helmet hair, no bangs covering the eyes, no waxy shine, no jagged artifacts along the forehead; no remnants of the original long hair visible; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms overlapping the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or beauty-filter skin smoothing. Technical/realism: Match the original lighting, shadows, color balance, and depth of field so the crop looks naturally photographed.
