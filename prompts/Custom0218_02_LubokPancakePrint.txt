===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve eye shape, smile line pattern, and overall face silhouette so the person remains recognizable. Modify flatten skin shading into print texture, simplify facial gradients, add bold contour lines, slightly stylize proportions for illustration coherence, apply paper grain and ink bleed. Result must still read as “you” because the eye shape + smile + face silhouette remain consistent. Only transform the center_face subject; deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected.
Transformation directives: Re-render the portrait as a lubok-inspired folk print illustration with flat colors, thick black outlines, ornamental florals, and playful folk motifs (including subtle pancake ornaments and festive patterns). Add a caption panel typical of lubok prints with a short playful line (use exact text: “ГЕРОЙ МАСЛЕНИЦЫ”) in a decorative folk type style. Keep other people unchanged in background if present (background_only), but keep them clearly secondary and less contrasty than the main subject.
Negatives: No photorealistic skin rendering, no modern digital gradients, no glossy 3D look, no anime style, no watercolor wash. No hands/arms from other people touching or interacting with the main subject; only the main subject’s own hands may be visible. No distorted facial structure beyond the specified HYBRID changes; no extra limbs; no text gibberish.
Technical/realism: Use a limited folk palette (2–5 strong flat colors), visible ink linework, slight misregistration feel, and subtle aged paper texture while keeping the face readable.
