===PROMPT===
Negatives: Remove the original background entirely; no visible modern objects, no phones, no app UI elements, no watermarks, no readable real names, no long paragraphs of text. No extra people: remove all other people completely, including hands, arms, or body parts from others; only the subject’s own hands may be visible. No distortion of facial features, no identity change, no exaggerated beauty edits, no extra fingers, no duplicated face, no warped jewelry, no broken typography.
Transformation directives: Create a cinematic “sealed letter” still-life scene featuring the chosen subject’s portrait printed on creamy textured paper placed on a wooden desk. Add a short handwritten note on a separate small card with generic text like “For you, tonight.” Place a wax seal on an envelope nearby, a softly glowing candle, subtle bokeh highlights, and gentle filmic atmosphere. Add a subtle monogram made of initials only (no full name) and a clean date stamp reading “7 March” in an elegant serif; keep all text minimal and non-personal.
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact face likeness, facial proportions, gaze, expression, skin tone accuracy, age, and identity of the subject. Only transform the largest_face subject; if there is a tie, choose by largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected. Keep the subject’s recognizable features unchanged even if the original photo is low quality.
Technical/realism: Render with photorealistic detail, natural paper texture and wax translucency, cinematic shallow depth of field, warm candlelight with soft shadows, high resolution, clean edges, and realistic typography.
