===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by creating a modern urban scene where the same person (face preserved, recognizable) is alone, casually leaning beside a sleek, unbranded supercar. Composition: vertical portrait, medium-full body (knees-up), camera slightly wide at hip height for a cinematic “after the win” feel; subject is foreground-center with relaxed stance, one shoulder against the car, hands easy (one in pocket, one resting lightly). Expression is neutral and calm—no big grin, no “posing,” just existing. Background: minimalist modern architecture (glass, concrete, clean lines) in muted tones; soft reflections on the car body, but no visible badge, logo, or readable text. Lighting: overcast-diffused daylight or late afternoon soft sun, gentle specular highlights on the car, clean color grading, subtle depth of field. Wardrobe: understated street-luxury (neutral jacket, clean sneakers/boots), no logos.
Constraints: solo subject only; no readable branding on car/buildings; no license plates readable; no extra people/reflections with faces; correct hands/fingers; keep scene uncluttered and premium.
