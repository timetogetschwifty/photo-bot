Transform this photo into a photorealistic recreation of the classic two-panel “woman yelling at cat” meme format. Divide the final image into two side-by-side panels with clean vertical separation and optional white top and bottom borders reserved for meme text in bold Impact-style sans-serif, keeping the text area minimal and unobtrusive. In the left panel, stage the uploaded person as the dramatic yelling subject in a reality-TV freeze-frame aesthetic: maintain their exact facial features, face shape, skin tone, hair color and style, body proportions, gender presentation, and any glasses, facial hair, or accessories. Preserve clear likeness and natural skin texture while intensifying the expression into a heightened but believable yelling pose with mouth open, brows raised, and one hand pointing or gesturing emphatically. Place them in an upscale dinner or neutral interior setting with bright, high-contrast indoor lighting, sharp detail, and subtle depth of field, keeping proportions natural and avoiding distortion, extra limbs, or artifacts.

In the right panel, place a white short-haired cat seated at a dining table with a plate of salad or simple food in front of it, facing slightly toward the left panel. The cat should have a confused, blank, or mildly unimpressed expression, rendered with realistic fur texture and softer, more neutral lighting to contrast the emotional intensity of the left side. Keep the overall look as a clean, sharp social-media screenshot with balanced color grading, crisp edges, accurate hand anatomy, and photorealistic detail throughout, ensuring comedic dramatic energy without aggression or violence. If multiple people are present, select the most prominent individual as the yelling subject and keep others subtly blurred in the background of the left panel without duplicating the confrontation.
