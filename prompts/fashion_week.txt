===PROMPT===
Transform this photo into a candid front-row runway moment captured live during a luxury fashion week show. Maintain the core facial structure, exact facial proportions, eye color, natural expression patterns, ethnicity, skin tone, and the exact number of people present. The subject must remain clearly recognizable. Modify only through professional editorial elevation: apply refined high-fashion makeup with defined contour, luminous skin highlights, subtle dramatic eye detailing, and realistic professional skin retouching while preserving natural texture. Restyle the hair into a polished, runway-appropriate look and elevate the wardrobe to couture-level styling without altering body proportions.

Recompose the scene so the subject is seated in a velvet or luxury-upholstered front-row chair, body angled toward a glossy reflective runway, gaze directed at a model walking past — not at the camera. Capture the exact split second a model in avant-garde couture strides through the foreground or midground with controlled motion blur only on the moving figure. Insert paparazzi silhouettes behind the subject with visible flash bursts firing mid-action. Add a champagne glass catching highlights and a reserved seat card in elegant serif typography. Use deep black and gold color grading with realistic event flash lighting — hard flash interacting with ambient runway glow — and natural reflections across skin and fabric. Maintain sharp focus on the subject with slight depth-of-field separation, 85mm press-photography lens feel, subtle natural grain, high dynamic range, and an observational documentary composition. Avoid distortion of facial features, no structural face changes, no extra limbs, no artificial posing, no over-smoothing, no cartoon styling, and no identical static model blur across the entire frame — only localized motion on the passing model.
