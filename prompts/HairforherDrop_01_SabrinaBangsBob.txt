===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity and facial likeness of the center_face subject (same face shape, facial proportions, eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips, skin tone, expression, age, and gender), plus the original head position, body pose, clothing, accessories, background, composition, and the exact number of people. Keep all non-hair elements unchanged.
Transformation directives: Only transform the center_face subject’s hair into a softly rounded bob cut that sits between jaw and chin length, with a sleek polished finish and a subtle undercurve at the ends for a doll-like silhouette. Add full, dense “Sabrina” bangs that are straight across and eyebrow-grazing, with clean edges and even thickness, framing the face symmetrically and integrating naturally at the hairline. Ensure the bob has smooth curvature, slightly tucked-under ends, and realistic strand flow with a neat, pop-forward vibe; keep hair color consistent with the original unless the original color is unclear, then choose a natural dark brown. If there are other people in the photo, keep the center_face subject perfectly sharp while blurring all other people so they remain recognizable as background figures without competing focus.
Negatives: Do not change the face, eyebrows, eye shape, makeup, skin texture, or expression; no face slimming, no eye enlargement, no beauty-filter look. No remnants of the original hairstyle visible (no old bangs, no stray original ponytail pieces, no duplicated hair layers), and no wig-like helmet shape or floating hair; hair must attach cleanly at the scalp with a believable hairline. No hair covering the eyes; bangs must stop at the eyebrows and not obscure vision. No extra people added, no swapping identities, no merging faces; no hands/arms from other people intruding into the main subject area, and no sharp focus on background people (they must be blurred). No distortions, warping, or artifacts around the ears, jawline, or fringe edges.
Technical/realism: Match the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color balance, depth of field, and camera realism so the new haircut blends naturally.
