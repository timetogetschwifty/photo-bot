Transform this photo into a hyper-realistic Met Gala red carpet arrival at night. Preserve the exact face likeness, facial structure, skin tone, hairstyle identity, body proportions, and number of people from the original image, keeping each individual fully recognizable and maintaining their relative height and placement. Reimagine the setting as a grand museum-style gala entrance with wide stone steps and tall classical columns, a rich red carpet underfoot, velvet rope barricades, and a sleek black luxury limousine with its door open behind the subject as if they are stepping out mid-stride. Replace the current clothing with dramatic avant-garde haute couture: a sculptural couture gown with architectural silhouette, intricate embroidery, metallic accents, feathers, or structured detailing for feminine presentation, or a sharply tailored high-fashion tuxedo with bold couture elements for masculine presentation, styled appropriately for age if children are present. Add refined red carpet hair and makeup while keeping identity intact, along with statement jewelry or an elegant structured clutch. Introduce an event step-and-repeat backdrop with elegant gold typography reading “Met Gala” or “The Met Gala.” Illuminate the scene with intense multi-directional paparazzi flash bursts that create crisp highlights, hard-edged shadows, and specular reflections on fabric, jewelry, and the polished car surface, with deep nighttime blue shadows and rich red, black, and gold tones. Use shallow depth of field so photographers and crowd silhouettes appear softly blurred in the background while the subject remains sharply in focus, frozen mid-step with subtle motion energy. Enhance clarity and reduce noise if the input is low quality, but avoid altering facial features, over-smoothing skin, distorting proportions, adding extra limbs, or introducing visual artifacts. The final image should feel like authentic high-end editorial press photography captured during a real Met Gala arrival.
