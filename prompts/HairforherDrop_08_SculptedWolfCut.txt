===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) including facial likeness, proportions, skin tone, expression, and gaze; keep pose, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition unchanged; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only transform the hair of the center_face subject into a “sculpted wolf cut”: strong, defined crown volume, tapered layers that frame the face, and textured ends that flow into a modern mullet-like silhouette while staying sharp and structured (not chaotic); ensure layered geometry is believable with realistic strand separation and a natural hairline around temples and nape; blur all other people into the background while keeping the main subject sharp. Negatives: Do not alter the face; no overly messy shag explosion, no random spikes, no uneven melted layers, no wig-like edges, no visible remnants of the original hairstyle; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms intruding or touching the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or artificial skin smoothing. Technical/realism: Match the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color, and depth of field so the wolf cut blends naturally.
