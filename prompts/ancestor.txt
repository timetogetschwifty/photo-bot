Transform the uploaded photo into a cinematic prehistoric portrait “Neanderthal Ancestor Reveal,” reimagining the subject or group as realistic members of a Homo neanderthalensis tribe while strictly preserving each person’s exact facial identity, proportions, eye spacing, nose shape, bone structure, and overall recognisability. Apply subtle, anthropologically accurate Neanderthal anatomical traits—slightly heavier brow ridge, gently broadened nasal bridge, modest jaw strengthening, and softly increased facial bone density—without exaggeration or caricature. Enhance skin with natural weather exposure, fine texture detail, light environmental roughness, and earthy tonal variation. Maintain calm, alert, survival-focused expressions with neutral lips and attentive eyes. Retain natural hair color while adjusting length and styling to appear slightly longer, wind-affected, and minimally groomed with organic matte texture, optionally secured with simple leather ties or primitive braids. Replace modern clothing with authentic Ice Age garments constructed from stitched animal hides and layered fur, fitted naturally to each body, incorporating rough leather belts, woven cords, bone or stone accessories, and primitive footwear; materials should look functional, worn, and historically plausible. Position the subjects as a small prehistoric tribe near a cave entrance or rocky overlook, posed naturally—standing with stone tools or wooden spears, crouching near a controlled fire, or surveying the landscape—while keeping every face clearly visible and sharply defined. Integrate realistic props such as stone hand axes, woven pouches, stacked rocks, and a small campfire emitting subtle smoke. Set the scene within an Ice Age environment featuring rugged terrain, a cave opening, distant mountains, sparse vegetation, and a misty valley with gentle atmospheric haze for depth. Use early morning or sunset natural light combined with soft warm firelight accents along faces and garment edges. Apply cinematic color grading dominated by earth tones, muted greens, cool stone grays, and soft amber highlights, with subtle airborne dust or smoke particles enhancing realism. Avoid fantasy stylisation, theatrical costuming, exaggerated anatomy, modern objects, artificial glossiness, or cartoon-like rendering.
