===PROMPT===
Transform the person in this photo into their prehistoric tribal ancestor at the moment immediately after a successful hunt, standing elevated on a rock at the mouth of a cave at dusk as a dominant Fire Chief. Using the original person’s facial structure as genetic and evolutionary inspiration, generate a different individual from approximately 40,000 years ago with a pronounced heavy brow ridge casting deep shadow over the eyes, significantly broader jaw and cheekbones with robust archaic bone structure, a wider nose with flared nostrils and thicker nasal bridge, forward mid-face projection, deeper-set eyes, stronger facial asymmetry, and visibly reinforced skeletal robustness. Create thicker, rougher, weathered leathery skin with visible pores, primitive scars, and ritualistic markings. Add smeared ochre and charcoal war paint across the forehead and cheeks. Maintain family resemblance only through the same eye color, a subtle echo of overall facial proportion balance, and the general head shape silhouette. The result must be clearly a different ancient ancestor, not the same modern face with makeup, avoid keeping the original face unchanged or recognizable as the same person.

Replace all modern clothing with layered animal furs and primitive leather wrappings, detailed natural fur fibers moving in strong wind. Add bone necklaces, carved tooth pendants, primitive arm bindings, and a rough wooden spear gripped firmly in one hand. Place mammoth tusks near the cave entrance. Below the elevated rock, render silhouettes of tribe members gathered with lit torches, minimal detail, subordinate in scale, sparks and embers rising sharply into smoky twilight air. Create a vast wild landscape beyond with gathering storm clouds overhead. Use cinematic realism with raw natural light, dramatic Caravaggio-inspired chiaroscuro firelight against cool storm blues, high dynamic range contrast between warm orange flames and cold sky. Show wind visibly moving hair and fur. Ultra-detailed paleoanthropological realism with museum-level anatomical accuracy and AAA cinematic concept art finish, subtle film grain, realistic volumetric smoke, sharp embers frozen mid-air, shallow depth of field separating the leader from the tribe. Remove all modern artifacts, buildings, and technology. Avoid distortion, no extra limbs, no contemporary elements.
