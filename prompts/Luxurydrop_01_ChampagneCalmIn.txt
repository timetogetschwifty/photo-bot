===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by placing the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable) alone in the rear seat of a chauffeured ultra-luxury sedan at night. Camera is from the front passenger side looking slightly back, a cinematic medium shot (waist-up) with the subject centered-left; their gaze is angled out the window, not to camera, with a neutral “nothing to prove” expression and relaxed shoulders. Premium interior details read through materials not labels: matte black leather, subtle stitching, brushed metal trim, soft suede headliner; clean, minimal cabin with deep depth-of-field separation. Outside the window: soft city light bokeh and streaks of passing traffic, warm reflections gliding across the glass. A single understated champagne flute sits in the subject’s hand or on the armrest, catching a small highlight (no branding, no readable text). Lighting: warm practical cabin light + cool city spill creating gentle rim light on hair and cheek, smooth skin tones, filmic contrast, slight grain, glossy but restrained. Keep the mood quiet, private, expensive, effortless—no flashy posing, no exaggerated smile.
Constraints: solo subject only, no extra people or reflections showing another face; no readable text/logos/watermarks; natural hands and correct fingers; avoid clutter and avoid any brand badges.
