===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the main subject’s face, identity, age, skin tone, facial proportions, expression, or gaze. Do not add extra people; keep any other people as background-only unchanged presence (not transformed), and do not let their hands/arms touch or overlap the main subject; only the subject’s own hands may be visible interacting with bouquet. No harsh neon glow, no sci-fi lighting, no glowing eyes/teeth, no plastic skin, no extra limbs/fingers, no distorted text, no misspellings, no unreadable ribbon tag, and no random props that weren’t requested.

Transformation directives: Transform only the SOLO subject chosen by center_face (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). Reimagine the photo at twilight with warm lanterns hanging overhead (soft golden light sources above the subject, like an outdoor evening event). Make the huge bouquet glow softly as if lit from within using a subtle bioluminescent effect (gentle inner radiance, not neon, not overpowering), illuminating nearby petals and the subject’s hands naturally. Add a small ribbon tag attached to the bouquet that clearly reads: “8 March” (use a clean, legible print style on the tag). Keep the overall scene magical but believable: lantern light should create warm highlights and soft shadows on the subject and bouquet.

Identity invariants: Preserve the exact facial likeness of the selected main subject (center_face), including bone structure, eye shape, nose, mouth, hairstyle, skin tone accuracy, and overall identity. Preserve the subject’s body proportions, pose, and wardrobe unless the original clothing becomes unclear due to lighting—if so, keep it visually consistent with the original. Keep other people (if present) as background-only unchanged, without making them the focus.

Technical/realism: Cinematic photoreal twilight grade with warm lantern key light, soft bloom highlights, realistic shadow falloff, natural skin texture, and high detail on flowers, ribbon tag text, and postcard paper.
