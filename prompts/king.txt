===PROMPT===
Negatives: Remove all modern clothing, casual accessories, logos, streetwear, contemporary interiors, cars, phones, modern lighting fixtures, and the original background entirely. Remove all other people completely, including hands, arms, or body parts from others—only transform the largest-face subject (if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). No extra crowns on the wrong place, no duplicated jewelry, no warped hands, no extra fingers, no distorted facial geometry, no mismatched eye direction, no plastic skin, no smeared details, no blurry face, no melted chandeliers, no unreadable insignia blobs.

Transformation directives: Transform the main subject into a Russian Tsar/Tsarina at the peak of imperial grandeur, posed as a frozen coronation portrait in a candlelit Winter Palace throne hall. Dress them in rich brocade robes with gold embroidery, a fur-trimmed mantle, jeweled orders/medals and sash, ornate rings, and a luminous imperial crown/diadem with gemstones; ensure period-accurate materials (ermine-like fur, heavy velvet/brocade, polished gold, cut gems). Place them seated beside a grand gilded throne (or standing beside it if the original pose is standing), with gilded columns, massive chandeliers, red velvet drapes, polished parquet, and tall palace windows showing faint snowfall drifting outside. Capture “the moment”: an attendant has just stepped out of frame, candle flames flicker, cold air is present, and a single snowflake melts on the fur collar; the mood is sacred ceremony plus intimidating power, “final boss of royalty,” museum-grade portrait energy.

Identity invariants: Preserve exact likeness, eye color, unique facial marks (freckles/moles), overall face proportions, and expression. Modify subtle “regal” refinement (cleaner skin texture, slightly sharper cheekbones/jawline), aristocratic styling, optional gentle age shift (+5–10 years) to feel authoritative, period-accurate makeup/hair polish. You must still look like you. Preserve natural skin tone accuracy and keep the subject’s gaze direction and head orientation consistent with the input photo.

Technical/realism: Render as cinematic historical portrait realism with extremely fine fabric/jewelry detail; warm golden candle key light plus cool icy blue rim light from the windows, realistic shadows and reflections on gold and gemstones, crisp focus on face, crown, and fur texture, subtle depth of field, high-resolution, artifact-free.
