Transform this photo into a formal late 18th–19th century Russian Imperial oil portrait, reimagining the subject as a fully realized Tsar or Tsarina of the Romanov era. Preserve the exact facial likeness, bone structure, gaze, skin tone, age accuracy, gender presentation, body proportions, pose orientation, and the number of people in the image so the identity remains unmistakable. Replace all modern clothing and elements with authentic imperial regalia: an ermine-trimmed deep crimson velvet mantle with heavy gold thread embroidery, jeweled imperial crown, sash of the Russian Empire, medals and orders pinned to the chest, and an ornate golden scepter held with natural authority. Set the scene inside a grand palace hall with towering white marble columns, rich red velvet drapes, and a gilded throne in the background, composed according to formal Romanov ceremonial portraiture. Render in refined 19th-century academic realism with painterly but controlled brushwork, not impressionistic or cartoonish, with ultra-high detail in textiles, fur texture, and gemstone refraction. Illuminate the figure with warm Rembrandt-style candlelit chiaroscuro, key light from an upper side source, gentle rim light separating crown and shoulders, deep cinematic shadows, and soft background falloff. Apply museum-grade oil painting texture with subtle visible brushstrokes, fine canvas grain, rich crimson and antique gold color grading, ivory highlights, high dynamic range depth, and a 4K fine art scan aesthetic. Maintain natural anatomy, avoid distortion of facial features, no extra limbs, no artifacts, and ensure the result feels like a timeless masterpiece unveiled in the Winter Palace in 1890 rather than costume or theatrical fantasy.
