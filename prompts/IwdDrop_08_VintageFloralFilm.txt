===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve each person’s identity separately with exact facial likeness, facial structure, skin tone, and expression; no face merging, no identity swapping, and keep the number of people the same. Transformation directives: Render the entire image as a 1970s-style film photo with warm Kodachrome-like tones, soft grain, slight light leaks, and sun-kissed highlights on the flowers, while keeping faces true-to-life and recognizable. Apply the same vintage treatment consistently across the group, up to a maximum of 4 people, maintaining natural skin texture under the film look. If more than 4 people are present, apply the film treatment primarily to the top 4 subjects by largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face priority and slightly blur remaining subjects for shallow depth of field while keeping them as background context. Negatives: No modern digital HDR look, no oversharpening, no plastic skin, no heavy noise blocks, no extra limbs, no distorted faces, no added text or logos. Technical/realism: Authentic film response with gentle contrast, subtle halation, realistic grain size, and tasteful light-leak placement that does not obscure faces.
