===PROMPT===
Transform this photo into a humorous yet affectionate “babushka core” portrait set in a cozy Soviet-era коммуналка kitchen. Maintain the exact facial features, face shape, fur pattern, fur coloration, eye color, eye shape, nose, whiskers, muzzle proportions, facial symmetry, and expression of the pet exactly as they appear in the original image. Keep skin and fur texture, gaze direction, and bone structure completely unchanged. Only the costume, environment, lighting, and contextual props should change — the face must remain identical with no anthropomorphic alteration, no aging effects, and no stylized distortion.

Wrap the pet in a traditional Russian floral headscarf in deep red or burgundy tones inspired by Pavlovo Posad shawls, tied naturally under the chin. The scarf must frame the face without covering the eyes or altering facial proportions, drape with realistic woven wool texture, and adapt naturally around upright ears without flattening or anatomically changing them.

Place the pet seated at a small wooden kitchen table like the stern but loving matriarch of the household. Surround with a 1960s–1980s Soviet kitchen interior: patterned floral or geometric wallpaper, a tea glass in a metal podstakannik holder, jam jars, a ceramic teapot, enamel mugs, a plate of blini or cookies, a crochet tablecloth, an old refrigerator in the background, and a hanging kitchen towel. Use warm tungsten indoor lighting with soft shadow falloff, slightly vintage color grading, subtle film grain, shallow depth of field with gentle background blur, and high dynamic range with a warm tone bias. Render in slightly stylized realism, cinematic but not cartoonish, with subtle symmetrical composition for charm. Enhance clarity if the source image is low quality while preserving original fur details and natural proportions, avoid distortion, no extra limbs, no artifacts, and do not keep the environment modern.
