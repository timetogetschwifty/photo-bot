Core transformation instruction:
Transform the person in the uploaded photo into an iconic, highly recognizable classic 1980s “legendary mullet” look with a bold signature moustache, while keeping the face fully recognizable and preserving identity.

Face:
Maintain exact facial identity with 1:1 accuracy — same bone structure, eye spacing, nose, lips, skin tone, and expression. No beautification or reshaping. Add only subtle masculine grooming contrast through the hairstyle and moustache styling. Eyes must remain naturally aligned and looking forward.

Hair (iconic mullet):
Create a pronounced, statement-level mullet haircut:
• Front and crown: medium-length, slightly lifted volume with natural texture
• Sides: clearly shorter and tapered for strong contrast
• Back: noticeably longer layered section extending to the lower neck/upper shoulders with visible feathered flow and movement
• Texture: realistic strand separation, layered structure, soft feathering typical of classic 1980s rock mullets
• Density: full, healthy density without helmet-like stiffness
• Color: must exactly match the person’s natural hair color and beard color
• Ensure realistic lighting interaction, shadows along neck and shoulders, and natural stray strands for authenticity

Moustache (iconic signature):
Upgrade the moustache into a distinctive classic thick statement moustache:
• Fuller width extending slightly beyond mouth corners
• Slight natural downward curvature or subtle western-style sweep
• Realistic density with visible strand variation (not airbrushed)
• Color must exactly match scalp hair color
• Natural blending into the upper lip with correct soft shadow contact

Outfit & background:
Keep clothing, pose, and background unchanged.

Lighting & realism:
Ensure the new hair and moustache integrate perfectly with original lighting direction, including realistic highlight falloff, subtle shadowing under the hair mass, and natural edge blending without halo artifacts.

Preservation rule:
Keep the person’s face recognizable and maintain their facial features and expression exactly as in the source image.
