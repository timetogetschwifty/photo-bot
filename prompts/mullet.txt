===PROMPT===
Transform this photo by completely removing all existing facial hair and replacing it with a clean, sculpted modern moustache while converting the hairstyle into a contemporary fashion mullet. Fully eliminate any beard, stubble, goatee, chin hair, or extended sideburns and reconstruct the underlying skin with realistic texture, preserving pores, natural tonal variation, and subtle post-shave softness without blur patches, smudging, or artificial smoothness. Maintain the exact facial likeness, jawline shape, cheek structure, skin tone, expression, lighting, shadows, camera angle, framing, clothing, accessories, background, body proportions, and number of people in the image. Add a well-groomed modern moustache with natural density and clean edges, slightly refined with a subtle retro influence but not exaggerated, no handlebar styling and no comedic or vintage 1800s appearance, ensuring it matches the hair color and integrates seamlessly with upper lip lighting and shadow. Convert the hairstyle into a 2023–2025 modern mullet with a textured top, soft fade or clean taper on the sides, visible above medium length in the back, and natural blending at the temples and nape, respecting the subject’s original hair texture and color with realistic volume and strand detail. Ensure photorealistic skin reconstruction under previously bearded areas, accurate shadow continuity, no halo effects, no edge artifacts, no distortion of facial features, no extra elements, and a seamless high-resolution finish that looks like a professional barbershop makeover photographed in real life.
