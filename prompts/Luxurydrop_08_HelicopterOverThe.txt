===PROMPT===
Generate an image based on the uploaded photo by creating a helicopter interior scene with the same person (face preserved, clearly recognizable) alone, flying above a coastline. Shot design: tight-medium portrait (shoulders-up) from slightly in front and to the side, so the window reveals the aerial coast below in a sweeping diagonal; the subject stays the hero, sharp focus, with a steady neutral expression like the view is normal. Hair is subtly wind-softened; optional simple aviation headset with no branding and clean design (only if it looks natural on the subject). Interior: dark, minimal seats and framing; outside: turquoise water, cliffs or beach curves, soft atmospheric haze. Lighting: daylight with soft directional highlights, gentle reflections on window glass (no ghost faces), cinematic clarity.
Constraints: solo subject only; no readable text/logos; avoid duplicate faces in reflections; correct headset fit if used; natural hands/shoulders; keep background clean and not overly busy.
