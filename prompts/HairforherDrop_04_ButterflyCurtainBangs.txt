===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) with unchanged facial likeness, facial proportions, skin tone, expression, and gaze; keep head position, pose, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition unchanged; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only change the hair of the center_face subject by adding “butterfly curtain bangs”: long curtain bangs that split naturally at the center, cascade in butterfly-style layers, and flip outward at the cheekbones for bouncy 90s-inspired face framing; blend the bangs into longer layers so they look like a real haircut, with soft volume at the roots and movement around cheeks and jaw; blur all other people into the background while keeping the main subject sharp. Negatives: Do not change the face; no bangs that look pasted-on, no hard cut edges, no symmetry glitches, no bangs covering the eyes; no remnants of the original front hairline/fringe conflicting with the new shape; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms interacting with the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or beauty-filter skin smoothing. Technical/realism: Keep the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color, and depth of field consistent so the bangs integrate naturally.
