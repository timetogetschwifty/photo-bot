===PROMPT===
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact identity of the main subject (center_face) with unchanged facial likeness, proportions, skin tone, expression, and head position; keep body posture, clothing, accessories, background, lighting direction, and composition unchanged; keep the number of people unchanged while only the main subject is edited. Transformation directives: Only transform the hair of the center_face subject into a “jellyfish cut” with strong contrast: a short rounded top layer that hugs the head shape plus longer separated tendrils underneath that hang distinctly longer, creating a clearly recognizable two-tier silhouette; keep edges clean but natural, with believable layering, realistic thickness, and a seamless transition at the hairline; blur all other people in the photo into the background while keeping the main subject sharply focused. Negatives: Do not alter the face; no melted or fused layers, no unnatural “sheet hair,” no extreme spiky artifacts, no mismatched hair direction, no visible remnants of the original hairstyle; no extra people added/removed; no other people’s hands/arms overlapping or touching the main subject; no text, logos, watermarks, or artificial skin smoothing. Technical/realism: Match the original photo’s lighting, shadows, color balance, and depth of field for a natural in-camera look.
