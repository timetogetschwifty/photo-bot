===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the cat’s facial identity or unique markings. Do not replicate the original photo’s body pose, posture, or composition. Remove all other subjects completely, including any partial faces, hands, arms, bodies, or tails from others; only the main cat remains. Only transform the SOLO subject selected by largest_face; if tied, choose largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected. No modern household clutter, no collars/leashes from the original photo, no text, watermarks, logos, or symbols. No extra limbs, no armor intersecting through fur, no distorted paws, no duplicate helmets.

Transformation directives: Dress the selected cat in ornate lacquered samurai armor scaled to feline anatomy: layered shoulder plates, a fitted chest cuirass, and foreleg guards that still look comfortable and flexible. Add a small helmet with a tasteful crest sized for a cat, leaving ears visibly comfortable and not crushed. Scene becomes a dramatic dojo interior with warm lantern light, wooden beams, and floating dust motes. Compose it as a cinematic hero portrait: the cat standing with a proud, grounded stance, front paws planted, chest forward, camera at cat-eye level with a slightly wide cinematic look. Add subtle atmospheric depth (soft haze) and dramatic highlights along lacquer edges.

Identity invariants: Preserve the exact facial likeness of the cat (face shape, eye shape, nose, mouth, whisker pads), fur pattern, fur color, and any distinctive marks; keep the face photographic and unchanged.

Technical/realism: Photorealistic armor materials (lacquer sheen, metal edging, fabric ties), realistic warm lantern lighting with soft shadows, high detail on fur and whiskers.
