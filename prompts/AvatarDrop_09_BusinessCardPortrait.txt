===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the person’s face identity or facial structure. No plastic skin, no heavy beauty filter, no exaggerated masculine/feminine alterations. Remove all other people completely, including hands, arms, or body parts from others. No text, no logos, no watermarks. No AI artifacts, no double pupils, no extra fingers.
Transformation directives: Create a confident, print-friendly portrait suitable for business card layouts: slight natural angle (subtle turn), modern monochrome or muted color grade, clean backdrop, crisp detail. Only transform the sharpest-face subject (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). Compose with intentional negative space on one side (leave clean empty area) for future layout use, while keeping head-and-shoulders framing.
Identity invariants: Preserve exact facial likeness, proportions, expression, and skin tone accuracy of the selected subject; keep them fully recognizable and unchanged.
Technical/realism: Photorealistic, high-resolution, print-ready sharpness, controlled contrast, clean background edges.
