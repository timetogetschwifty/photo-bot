===PROMPT===
Negatives: Remove all other people completely, including any hands, arms, faces, reflections, or body parts from others; keep only the main subject (center_face). Do not include real names, usernames, contact info, locations, addresses, landmarks, or any identifying text from the original image; do not preserve background signage or readable text. Do not change the subject’s facial identity or features; no face reshaping, no age change, no skin tone shift, no glam “beautify” that alters likeness. No extra limbs, duplicated faces, warped fingers, text glitches, unreadable typography, or messy layout; avoid brand-like logos, watermarks, or QR codes.
Transformation directives: Create a clean, modern “dedication card” layout with a split composition: the subject portrait on one side (cropped and framed neatly), and minimal graphic shapes on the other side (simple geometric forms, subtle gradients, modern negative space). Keep the portrait tasteful and premium, with a midnight vibe (dark, elegant, calm). Add one short dedication line in the design, choosing exactly one from this set: “Only for her.” OR “Tonight is yours.” OR “Just you.” OR “For your eyes only.” OR “Made for this night.” Ensure the text is crisp, centered or intentionally aligned, and looks like high-end editorial design.
Identity invariants: Preserve exact facial likeness, facial proportions, expression, gaze, skin tone, age, and identity of the center_face subject; preserve natural hair and key personal features so the person is clearly the same individual. Keep the subject’s pose broadly consistent (no extreme pose changes), but allow tasteful crop/reframe to fit the card layout.
Technical/realism: High-resolution modern graphic design + photo composite, clean edges, balanced spacing, premium typography (minimal sans-serif), deep midnight palette (charcoal/black with subtle cool highlights), studio-quality portrait clarity with no compression artifacts.
