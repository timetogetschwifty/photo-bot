===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the main subject’s face, identity, age, gender, skin tone, facial proportions, or expression. Do not make the face look like a different person, do not add face paint, do not beautify, and do not alter eye shape, nose shape, lip shape, or jawline. No extra people added, no extra limbs, no warped hands, no duplicated faces, no text gibberish, no misspelled Cyrillic, no random symbols, no modern logos, no modern photoreal background left behind. If the photo contains other people, do not transform them; keep them only as background context and ensure they do not interact with the main subject (no hands/arms touching the main subject).
Transformation directives: Transform only the largest_face subject (deterministic fallback if tied: largest_face > sharpest_face > center_face > first detected). Convert the image into a bright Maslenitsa fair announcement poster in traditional Russian lubok style: bold black linework, simplified shapes, flat folk colors dominated by reds, yellows, and blues, with decorative ornamental border frames. Place the preserved face clearly and centrally as the “hero” of the poster, integrated into a folk illustration bust or half-length figure. Add a festive fairground scene behind the subject: stylized crowd silhouette, bunting flags, winter fair stalls, and folk ornaments. Include pancake and samovar motifs as clear illustrated icons, plus small decorative flourishes (rosettes, leaves, folk patterns) around the border. Reserve clear text spaces: a large Cyrillic headline area at top and a stylized name banner area reading exactly “16-22 Февраля”. Keep any other people in the background unchanged and simplified into the poster style only if they are already present; do not turn them into main characters.
Identity invariants: Preserve the exact likeness of the largest_face subject: same facial features, face shape, expression, gaze direction, and recognizable identity; keep head position and relative framing consistent. Keep the subject as a single main transformed person; all other detected people remain background_only and must not be transformed into the same stylized “hero” or merged with the main subject.
Technical/realism: Render as a crisp, high-resolution printed poster with clean vector-like linework, flat inks, slight paper texture, and strong legible typography areas without artifacts.
