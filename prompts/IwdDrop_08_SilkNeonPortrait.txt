===PROMPT===
Negatives: Do not change the subject’s facial identity or features; no face reshaping, no eye color change, no skin tone shift, no “beautify” filter that alters likeness. Do not add brand-like logos, signatures, watermarks, or recognizable trademarks; keep any tag purely minimal text. No location clues, no names, no private info, no readable background signage. If other people exist, do not transform them; keep them as background-only and non-distracting. No extra limbs, duplicated faces, warped hands, plastic skin, heavy noise, posterization, or neon color banding.
Transformation directives: Convert the photo into a sleek studio-style neon portrait with soft gradient lighting in pink/blue/purple, like a silky light wrap around the subject. Add subtle sparkle bokeh highlights in the background (small, tasteful, not busy), and create a premium “editorial” look with smooth neon transitions and gentle glow. Optionally add a tiny corner tag that reads “Eve of 8 March” (very small, classy, unobtrusive), placed in a corner with minimal typography. Only transform the sharpest_face subject; keep any other people unchanged in the background (background_only) and ensure the main subject remains the clear focal point.
Identity invariants: Preserve exact facial likeness, bone structure, expression, gaze, skin tone, age, and identity of the sharpest_face subject; keep recognizability fully intact. Maintain natural proportions and avoid altering distinctive facial marks; keep overall pose consistent while allowing studio-style lighting and background restyling.
Technical/realism: High-resolution studio portrait rendering with soft neon rim light, clean gradients (no banding), controlled bloom, crisp eyes and natural skin detail, shallow depth-of-field background, premium color grading with pink/blue/purple palette and smooth tonal roll-off.
